**Software and Libraries for the Capstone Project**

The capstone project is written in a jupyter notebook using Python 3.5.2, Pandas 0.18.1, Sklearn 0.18.1, Seaborn 0.7.1, Keras 2.0.4 with Tensorflow 1.0.1 backend.

I use the following CSV files, which were generated by an Excel .xlsm spreadsheet ('Bbg_Market_Data') with Bloomberg API: 'dataCL', 'dataC ', 'dataKC', 'dataGC', 'dataW ', 'dataS '. The main analysis is conducted on the csv file 'dataCL', which contains data on the Oil market.
