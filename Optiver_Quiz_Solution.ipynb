    "\n",
    "Three players A, B, C play the following game. First, A picks a real number between 0 and 1 (both inclusive), then B picks a number in the same range (different from A’s choice) and finally C picks a number, also in the same range, (different from the two chosen numbers). We then pick a number in the range uniformly randomly. Whoever’s number is closest to this random number wins the game. Assume that A, B and C all play optimally and their sole goal is to maximise their chances of winning. Also assume that if one of them has several optimal choices, then that player will randomly pick one of the optimal choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "- a) If A chooses 0, then what is the best choice for B?\n",
    "- b) What is the best choice for A?\n",
    "- c) Can you write a program to figure out the best choice for the first player when the game is played among four players?"

    "- I apply a *brute force* approach where I evaluate all possible combinations of choices for all players. \n",
    "- I assume the game is played between $0$ and $100$ (as these value can be interpreted as percentages) and I assume that $1\\%$ is the minimum distance two players' choices can differ by.\n",
    "- I represent the game decision tree as nested Python dictionaries, where each key of the dictionary corresponds to a decision of position for a given player.\n",
    "- Loosely speaking, the algorithm of the *optiver_tree()* function (which is the main function to solve the quiz) basically performs a dynamic optimization: for every choice of the players from the first to the last, it checks the optimal solution of the last player who has to choose and then propagates this optimal choice back to the preceeding player, and so on to the first player. The resulting decision tree represents the optimal choices for all players.\n",
    "- The optimal choice for any given player is obviously the choice that maximizes her probabilities of winning.\n",
    "- Several enhancements are possible, like taking into account the symmetry of the [0,1] interval, or avoiding the *brute-force* approach, since with only 5 players would take too long to evaluate (with 4 players the code below evaluates $94\\,109\\,400$ possible choices, while with 5 players it has to evaluate a whopping $9\\,034\\,502\\,400$ of possibile combinations!)."
